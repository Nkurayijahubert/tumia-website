# Tumia Website Deployment Options

I've created several deployment options for the Tumia website. Each option is contained in its own directory with all necessary configuration files and deployment instructions.

## Option 1: Vercel Deployment (Current Approach)

The current setup in the main repository is configured for Vercel deployment:

- `vercel.json` - Configuration that disables build steps
- `public/index.html` - Static HTML file for deployment
- `static.txt` - Marker file indicating this is a static site

**To deploy:**
1. Connect your Vercel account to GitHub
2. Import this repository
3. Vercel will automatically deploy the static site

## Option 2: GitHub Pages Deployment

A complete GitHub Pages deployment setup is available in the `github-pages-deploy` directory:

- Static HTML file
- GitHub workflow for automatic deployment
- .nojekyll file to bypass Jekyll processing
- Detailed README with setup instructions

**To deploy:**
1. Create a new repository with these files
2. Enable GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions as the source
3. The site will deploy automatically

## Option 3: Multi-Platform Deployment

The `deploy` directory contains configurations for multiple hosting platforms:

- Vercel configuration
- Netlify configuration (netlify.toml)
- Firebase configuration (firebase.json)
- Comprehensive README with instructions for each platform

**To use:**
1. Choose your preferred hosting platform
2. Follow the instructions in the README
3. Use the corresponding configuration file for your chosen platform

## Recommendation

If you're experiencing issues with Vercel, I recommend trying GitHub Pages deployment as it:

1. Is completely free
2. Has very simple setup
3. Provides reliable static site hosting
4. Supports custom domains
5. Requires minimal configuration

GitHub Pages is especially well-suited for static landing pages like this one.
