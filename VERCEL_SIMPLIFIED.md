# Simplified Vercel Deployment Guide

Since your site is displaying raw code instead of the proper HTML content, here's a simplified deployment process that will fix the issue:

## Option 1: Use "public" Directory Only (Recommended)

This approach uses Vercel's public directory feature for the most reliable deployment of static sites.

1. **Create a new Vercel project**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Click "Import from Git Repository" or select "Upload"

2. **If using the "Upload" option:**
   - Create a new directory on your computer
   - Copy ONLY the contents of the public/ directory to this new directory
   - Zip that directory and upload it to Vercel
   - Choose "Static build" when prompted

3. **If using GitHub import:**
   - Create a new repository with only the contents of the public/ folder
   - Make sure index.html is in the root of that repository
   - Connect it to Vercel
   - In the project settings, set "Build Command" to empty and "Output Directory" to "."

## Option 2: Use Custom Domain with Direct HTML File

If you just want to get something working immediately, try this completely different approach:

1. **Upload your HTML file to a service like Gist or Pastebin**
   - Create a GitHub Gist with your index.html contents
   - Get the "raw" URL for that Gist

2. **Use a URL redirector service**
   - Configure your domain to redirect to the raw Gist URL
   - This isn't ideal long-term but can get you showing content quickly

## Option 3: Use Another Static Hosting Service

As a temporary solution, you could use a different static site hosting service:

1. **Netlify Drop**
   - Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
   - Drag and drop your public folder there
   - It will instantly deploy and give you a URL
   - You can even connect your custom domain

2. **Surge.sh**
   - Install Surge: `npm install -g surge`
   - Navigate to your public directory
   - Run `surge`
   - Follow prompts and get a live URL in seconds

## Common Vercel Issues & Solutions

If you're seeing code displayed instead of your website:

1. **Wrong Content Type**: Vercel might be serving your HTML with the wrong content type. This often happens with complex configurations.

2. **Incorrect Entry Point**: Make sure your site's entry point is correctly defined. For static sites, this should be index.html in the root of the deployed directory.

3. **Build Process Interference**: The build process might be causing issues. Using null build commands helps, but sometimes even more simplification is needed.

4. **Wrong File Being Served**: Check in Vercel's deployment logs which file is being served for the root path.
